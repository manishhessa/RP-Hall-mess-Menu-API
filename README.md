# RP-Hall-mess-Menu-API
### Overview
This is an API to choose food menu of Mess by democratically Voting . Here in IIT Kharagpur, there are students across country they have different culture they speak various language their food preference are different so being an Auditor Mess, It was my responsibility to make such arrangement so that there is no single student that will feel leftout in Hall. SO we made this API that utilizes Schulze's Algorithm to that takes food preferences from students and make a ranking according to which we can we can make a menu that is justifiable for all students.

### About
As I have mentioned earlier this app is made using Schulze's Algorithm, Schulze's Algorithm, also known as the Schulze method or the Schulze Beatpath Method, is a voting system and a ranked voting method used to determine the winner in elections where voters rank candidates in order of preference. It is designed to identify a Condorcet winner if one exists or provide a close approximation to a Condorcet winner in cases where there is no clear Condorcet winner. Condorcet winner is a candidate who can beat every other candidate in head-to-head pairwise comparisons. 

### Appilicaton
Application of this API is done using excel sheet we gave few food options to studnts and they gave their preferences in an excel sheetand we fed that excel sheet to our API and it gave us food preferences and we got our top 7 foods. That is how we selected food in RP hall.
